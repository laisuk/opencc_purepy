**`opencc_purepy`** is a **pure Python implementation** of OpenCC (Open Chinese Convert), enabling conversion between
different Chinese text variants such as Simplified, Traditional, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japanese Kanji.  
It uses dictionary-based segmentation and mapping logic inspired by [BYVoid/OpenCC](https://github.com/BYVoid/OpenCC).

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Pure Python – no native dependencies
- 🔄 Supports conversion between multiple Chinese locales:
    - Simplified ↔ Traditional
    - Traditional ↔ Hong Kong / Taiwan / Japanese
- ✨ Optional punctuation style conversion
- 🧠 Automatic simplified/traditional code detection
- 🧾 CLI with Office document formats text conversion.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install opencc-purepy
```

## 🚀 Usage

### 🐍 Python

```python
from opencc_purepy import OpenCC

text = "“春眠不觉晓，处处闻啼鸟。”"
opencc = OpenCC("s2t")
converted = opencc.convert(text, punctuation=True)
print(converted)  # 「春眠不覺曉，處處聞啼鳥。」
```

### 🖥 CLI

#### 🔤 Text File Conversion

```sh
python -m opencc_purepy convert -i input.txt -o output.txt -c s2t -p
```

Or if installed as a script:

```bash
opencc-purepy convert -i input.txt -o output.txt -c s2t -p
```

#### 🧾 Office Document Conversion (`--office`)
Supports: `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.odt`, `.ods`, `.odp`, `.epub`

```bash
# Convert Word document (.docx) with font preservation
opencc-purepy convert --office -i example.docx -c t2s --keep-font

# Convert EPUB and auto-detect output name
opencc-purepy convert --office -i book.epub -c s2t --auto-ext

# Convert Excel and specify output path and format explicitly
opencc-purepy convert --office -i sheet.xlsx -o result.xlsx -c s2tw --format xlsx
```

> ℹ️ When --office is enabled, it will process the input as an Office or EPUB document and apply OpenCC conversion internally.

## 🧩 API Reference

### Class: `OpenCC`

- `OpenCC(config: str = "s2t")`
    - `config`: Conversion configuration (see above).
- `convert(input: str, punctuation: bool = False) -> str`
    - Convert text with optional punctuation conversion.
- `zho_check(input: str) -> int`
    - Detects the code of the input text.
        - 1 - Traditional,
        - 2 - Simplified,
        - 0 - others

## 🛠 Development

- Python bindings: [opencc_purepy/__init
  __.py](https://github.com/laisuk/opencc_purepy/blob/master/opencc_purepy/__init__.py), [opencc_purepy/opencc_purepy.pyi](https://github.com/laisuk/opencc_purepy/blob/master/opencc_purepy/opencc_purepy.pyi)
- CLI: [opencc_purepy/__main__.py](https://github.com/laisuk/opencc_purepy/blob/master/opencc_purepy/__main__.py)

## ⚡ Benchmark Results: `opencc_purepy`

> Measured on a local machine using the default "s2t" configuration.
> Each test was averaged over 5 runs using in-memory conversion with preloaded dictionaries.

| Input Size        | Average Time (ms) |
|-------------------|------------------:|
| **100 chars**     |      **0.119 ms** |
| **1,000 chars**   |      **0.962 ms** |
| **10,000 chars**  |      **9.665 ms** |
| **100,000 chars** |     **97.003 ms** |

#### 📝 Benchmark Notes

- All tests were performed using Python opencc_purepy with dictionaries preloaded from JSON.
- Conversion used OpenCC.convert(input_text) with segmentation and replacement logic.
- Timings exclude initialization time and focus on pure conversion speed.
